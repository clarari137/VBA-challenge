# VBA-Challenge: Stock Analysis

Sources:
For this assignment, I relied on the following class examples

  - 04-Ins_LoopConditionals
  
  - 06-Stu_Lotto-AdvancedForLoops
  
  - 01-Stu_StarsCounter
  
  - 02-Ins_Formatter
  
  - 06-Stu_Checkerboard-CodingLogic
  
  - 07-Stu_Census_Pt1
  
I also met with Danielle Dubash from our class to talk through our code and work out smaller issues. I used this website (https://software-solutions-online.com/vba-range-variable-row-number/) for help using the Range function, and this website (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.worksheetfunction.max) for clarity on the maximum and minimum functions.
